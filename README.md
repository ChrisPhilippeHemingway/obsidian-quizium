## üîÑ Spaced Repetition Rules

The spaced repetition system follows these principles:

2. **Automatic Updates**: Streaks are updated automatically - no manual tracking needed
3. **Streak Continuation**: Study on consecutive days to maintain and grow your streak
4. **Streak Breaks**: Missing a day resets your current streak, but your highest record is preserved
5. **Multiple Activities**: Both quiz completion and flashcard rating count toward streaks
6. **Same-Day Protection**: Multiple study sessions on the same day count as one streak day
